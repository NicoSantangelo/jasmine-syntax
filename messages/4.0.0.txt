New command! Toggle quotes

This command will change the snippets from the current active quotes to it's counterpart.

If you want to setup a keybinding for it, you can use:

`{ "keys": ["KEYS"], "command": "jasmine_toggle_quotes" }`

-----

Also if you didn't see it:

If you don't like using the extension `.spec.js` when creating the spec files now you can use the setting `spec_file_extension`.

The string you pass will be replaced for the `.js` extension of your javascript file, by default it's still `.spec.js` 

That's all, thanks!
