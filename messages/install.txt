Sorry to interrupt
==================

First of all, thanks for installing JasmineSyntax!

Second, take into account that any other packages that are using 'javascript' as a syntax may not work with 'jasmine'.

A notable example is SublimeLinter-jshint, where to fix this issue if you still want to use linting on your jasmine files you need to add a `syntax_map`
to the SublimeLinter settings (http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/global_settings.html#syntax-map), like this:

"syntax_map": {
    "html (django)": "html",
    "html (rails)": "html",
    "html 5": "html",
    "jasmine": "javascript", //here
    "php": "html",
    "python django": "python"
}


Thanks again!.
