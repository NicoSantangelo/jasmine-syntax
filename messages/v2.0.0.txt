Jasmine Pacakge
==================

Sorry for the interruption!

This is just to let you know that @caiogondim's https://github.com/caiogondim "Jasmine BDD" package has been combined with
@gja's https://github.com/gja "Jasmine" package, adding some new features in the process.

The idea is to have a unified Jasmine package for Sublime Text, that provides Commands, Snippets and Syntax.

For a bit more info, you can visit the package Github repo: https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-jasmine


Old Jasmine Users
--------------------

Everything should still work, but the old "Jasmine: Switch between code and spec" has been replaced (hopefully for the better).
If you still want to use the old command, you can pick "Jasmine (legacy): Switch between code and spec" from the command pallete.

Also, if you're on windows, the commands may take a bit to work the first time, after that, it should work fine.

--------------------


If you have any problems or you want to create an issue or a feature request, please let me know!

Thanks!
