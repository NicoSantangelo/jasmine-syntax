Jasmine Pacakge
==================

Sorry for the interruption!

@caiogondim's https://github.com/caiogondim "Jasmine BDD" package has been combined with @gja's https://github.com/gja "Jasmine" package.

For old users, everything should still work, but now the package has new features like:
Syntax highlighting and a 'toggle' command.

Take into account that any other packages that are using `javascript` as a syntax may not work with the new `jasmine`. 
You can always turn it back off by opening a `.spec.js` file and selecting "View > Syntax > Open all with current extension as... > Javascript".

Also, if you want a list of all snippets, create a issue or a feature request, head over to https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-jasmine

Thanks!
