Recent Changes
==============

Hello!

Some minor things:
- The indentation some snippets has been fixed
- Using `Toggle quotes` only changes the necessary snippets making it faster

**IMPORTANT**:

If you experience any problems it might be because of the workaround this package uses to provide snippets with double and single quotes (using the `Toggle quotes` command).
Restarting Sublime Text should fix it and if that doesn't do it, please try running `Toggle quotes`.
